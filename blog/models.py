        Adding a Meta class:
        The posts are listed from newest to oldest creation time:
        The ordering option adds metadata to the model about the default order in which the list of posts is displayed.
        The posts are now listed from oldest to newest creation time. The - prefix on created_on indicates the posts are displayed
        in descending order of creation date. If no leading - is used, then the order is ascending, and if a ? prefix is used, then the order is randomised.

        The Meta class provides additional information or metadata about the model. One of its options is ordering,
        which specifies how the records associated with the model are ordered. In this case, we've assigned the ordering option a
        list with a single item, the created_on field. You can list more than one field to order on; e.g. the following would order by created_on
        descending and then by author ascending.

        When adding posts up till now, they have appeared in the admin panel as Post object(n), where n is an integer denoting the order of posts being added.
        Now, as per the main image, they are identified in a human-readable manner.
        he __str__() method has changed this post identifier to a string literal. By passing self as an argument to the __str__() method,
        you can use the field values in the f-string.

        We also added a Python magic __str__ method to our Post model. We also call this a dunder method because double underscores surround the name.
        This method gives each post a name that superusers, rather than Python developers, can more easily understand. When we look at posts in the console or
        admin panel, this name helps us figure out which post is which.

        Other custom methods:
        You can add other similar methods like this to models to make them do more things, like calculating a user's age from their date of birth field or putting a
        preferred title in front of a name. In the world of web development, this helps keep our data organised and user-friendly.
