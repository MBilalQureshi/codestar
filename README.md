# Notes
Note: gunicorn my_project.wsgi is the command heroku will use to start the server. It works similarly to python3 manage.py runserver.

Note: psycopg2 is a driver for interacting with PostgreSQL databases using Python. The dj-database-url Python package is a utility to connect Django to a database using a URL.
